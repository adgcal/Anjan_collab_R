        "Some  intuitive notions about gravity was revealed to other cultures even in the pre-Newton period ascertains that intuitions pervade the time dimension.Conclusions on gravity was made by the Indian Mathematician Bhaskaracharyya @chatterjee2008encyclopaedic, @pingree1970history, @joseph2000crest,@sarma1979bhaskaracharya,@raghavan1988bhaskaracharya. Many great scientific discoveries relied heavily on intuitive insights.  The connections between intellect and intuition are one of the great mysteries of our universe anf the connection of intuitive ideas accross the time tunnel is interesting to note."

        "John Maynard Keynes was a British economist who is considered one of the most influential economists of the 20th century. He was also a close friend of the physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton. In his essay \"Newton the Man,\" Keynes wrote that Newton's \"powers of intuition were the strongest and most enduring with which a man has ever been gifted.\"Newton was able to see patterns in the motion of planets and stars that no one else had seen before. He was also able to see connections between different branches of mathematics and physics.Here are some of the ways in which Newton's intuition helped him to make his discoveries:\n",
        "- His intuition helped him to see patterns in the motion of planets and stars. This led to his development of the laws of motion and gravity.\n",
        "- His intuition helped him to see connections between different branches of mathematics and physics. This led to his development of calculus.\n",
        "- His willingness to take risks and to challenge the status quo. This led to his development of the theory of universal gravitation."

        "The other intuitive idea he has was the constancy of the velocity of light irresespective of velocity at which the observer is moving(@einstein1905). This intuitive conjecture was latter verified  by Michelsonâ€“Morley experiment (@michelson1887).\n"

Based on his observations of the properties of different elements, Mendeleev arranged them in a tabular form, leaving gaps for undiscovered elements. His intuition led him to predict the existence and properties of these missing elements, which were later discovered and confirmed his predictions"

Ramanujan credited the Hindu goddess Namagiri for revealing mathematical formulas and identities to him during his dreams. His intuitive insights led to significant contributions to number theory, infinite series, and mathematical analysis."

He once described how the idea of electrons moving in discrete orbits around the nucleus of an atom came to him in a dream. This dream-inspired insight helped form the foundation of the Bohr model of the atom."
