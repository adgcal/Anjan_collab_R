        "There are several different estimates of the improbability of our existence, but they all point to the fact that it is incredibly unlikely. One estimate, by astrophysicist Brandon Carter, puts the odds of our existence at 1 in $10^{120}$.</p> This is a number so large that it is difficult to comprehend. It is estimated that there are $10^{80}$ atoms ($1.661 \\cdot 10^{56}$)in the observable universe, so the odds of our existence are equivalent to randomly picking one atom out of the entire universe and finding that it is a copy of your entire body.\n",

        "Another estimate, by physicist Frank Tipler , puts the odds of our existence at 1 in $10^{10^{120}}$. This is an even larger number than Carter's estimate. Tipler's estimate is based on the fact that the laws of physics are so finely tuned that they allow for the existence of life. If the laws of physics were even slightly different, life as we know it would not be possible.\n"
